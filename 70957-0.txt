INTRODUCTION

ON

THE GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION OF LANGUAGES,

_Chiefly from_ DR. LATHAM.


AFRICAN.—The best way to study the wide and complex philology of
Africa is to begin with the frontier of the Semitic languages,
remembering that the Ethiopic branch of them is, to all appearance,
indigenous to Africa; then to bear in mind that the Arabic, by
intrusion and extension, is spread over a great part of Northern and
Eastern Africa. The Eastern frontier, however, of the Arabic and
the Syriac is in Asia, and in Asia it begins where the Persian and
Turk areas end. For the philological geography of Africa it will be
found useful to divide the continent into the following sections,
regions, or areas: (1) The first division as North-Eastern until it
approaches the Equator, and the parts between it and the Red Sea—in
geography, Egypt, Nubia, and Abyssinia, in philology the Coptic,
Beja, Nubian, and (in its geographical sense) the Abyssinian regions.
(2) The Barbary States and Canary Islands. (3) The Desert, divided
into the Western or Great (the Sahara), and the Eastern (or Libyan)
Desert. (4) Senegambia, or the drainages of the Senegal and Gambia.
(5) Sudania. This gives us what we get nowhere else in Africa,
a continuous belt or zone of languages, with fairly determined
boundaries from Senegambia to Abyssinia, _i.e._, across the whole
continent in its broadest part. Within the limits of this zone lie
the fundamental materials for the study of African philology and
ethnology. It is only, however, between the parallels of 10° and 15°
N.L. that it is continuous, and this only approximately. (6) The
Coast line. This means the sea-board of the Grain, Ivory, Gold, and
Slave Coasts. (7) The Delta (of the Niger). This brings us within
the Equator, but only on the side of the Atlantic. The Abyssinian
extends to (there or thereabouts) the same parallels on the side of
the Indian Ocean. Neither, however, carries us beyond a limited area
inland. Where these two limits, East and West, end, South Africa
begins. It is, with the exception of the few degrees of latitude just
indicated, either equatorial or belonging to the Southern tropic; it
falls into two divisions. (8) The Inter-Tropical, or Kaffir. (9) The
Extra-Tropical, or Hottentot. All these divisions are simply what
their names imply, except only that Senegambia is made to reach as
far as Cape Mesurado, so as to include the parts about Sierra Leone
and Cape Mount.

AMERICAN.—The primary division is that between North and South. (1)
In North America the connection with Asia is decided. Through the
Aleutian dialect of the Eskimo and the Kamtschatkan it is direct;
through the Yukahiri and other tongues it is indirect. The Eskimo
is a definite class; the Athabascan is also a definite class when
compared with the Algonkin. The Chemmesyan, Hailtsa, Wakash, and
Chinook are connected. The Jakon and Kallapuiah lead to the languages
of the Sahaptin and Shoshoni class, among the congeners of which
the sound of “tl” appears. In the Mexican it becomes prominent.
Between the Rocky Mountains and the Pacific the Algonkin appears
to have spread from West to East, and the result has told most on
the Iroquois family. The South Oregon languages graduate into the
Californian, the Californian into those of the Paduca class and those
of Sonora, till we come to two great divisions, the Mexican and the
Maya. (2) In South America there is a reappearance of the phenomena
of the North: what the Athabascan and Algonkin are in the one
peninsula, the Quichua, the Carib, and, above all, the Guarani are
in the other. With any South American vocabulary of adequate length,
some North American root presents itself; some even from the extreme
North, viz., the Eskimo area, which, along with the phenomena of
transition, is the chief argument in favour of the fundamental unity
of the two classes. The student from Peru finds Quichua words in
every vocabulary he lights upon, whilst the student from Brazil finds
Guarani words.

ASIAN.—Asia and Europe, though different quarters of the globe,
form but a single continent, and as such have characteristics of
their own. One great class of languages is absolutely common to the
two—the great Ugrian or Fin family. We miss, no doubt, in Europe such
districts as those of Caucasus, and the parts to the North of the
Burmese Empire, where numerous mutually unintelligible languages are
pressed together within a small area. Again, the inflected languages
have their seat in Europe; the monosyllabic in Asia. On the other
hand, it is only in the great central continent that Language can be
studied in all its stages: the Monosyllabic stage in the South-East
of Asia, and the Inflectional in Western and Southern Europe. This
makes Asia and Europe the only region in which the whole (or nearly
the whole) history of Language can be studied. Besides this, in
Europe and Asia we have a history. We can see how languages like the
English and Russian are extending themselves; how the German has
extended itself; how the Latin had previously extended itself. We can
see how languages like the Keltic, the Lithuanic, and the Fin recede.
(1) The Western division is the one with which we are most familiar;
it includes Great Britain, France, Spain, Italy, Germany, the Valley
of the Danube, and Greece; allowance being made for the Turk and
Hungarian, which are intrusive. (2) The great Northern area is in
Russia conterminous with the Western, which means, roughly speaking,
Northern Asia with a large part of Europe; the chief displacements
having been effected by the great spread of the Turk language. (3)
The South-Eastern area begins with the North frontier of China, and
includes Thibet, Nipal, the Transgangetic peninsula, Assam, Siam,
Pegu, Cambogia, Cochin-China, and China. (4) The South-Western
area contains India, Persia, and the Caucasus; here the displacing
languages are Indian, Persian, and Arabic, which last is treated as
African.

OCEANIC.—The first thing which commands attention is its thorough
insular or oceanic character; subordinate to this is the remarkable
distribution of its members. In one great division, viz., the
Polynesian, the diffusion has been decidedly recent. The first
primary division contains the Malay; the second has been called
Micronesian; the third division is Polynesia proper. The second group
is called Kelenonesian or Melanesian, including Papuan, Australian,
and Tasmanian (“Elements,” p. 377). Australian languages are all upon
the same general grammatical construction. Mr. Moorhouse says that
“not one-twentieth part of the words agree in root, and yet there is
evidence sufficient to satisfy any one that they belong to the same
family.” All have suffixes to show relation; a dual in substantives,
adjectives, and pronouns; no sibilant sounds, no auxiliary verb,
no passive voice, no “h,” they abound in the pleonastic, and
distinguish genders by postfixes. The only point of agreement is in
the first personal pronoun, “I”; this is “nga-nga” on the Swan River;
“nga-toa” in New South Wales; “nga-ti,” Adelaide; “ngai-tyo,” Mount
Barker; “gni,” Murchison River; “nga-pe,” Encounter Bay; “ngai,”
Port Lincoln; “nga-ppo,” Murray River; “naddo,” Murrumbidgee River;
“nga-pe,” Lower Murray; “noga-toa,” Hunter River. At the same time,
the Malayan is “nga-n”; the Sumba, “nga-nga”; the Thibetian, “nga”;
the Corean, “nai”; and the Burmese, “ngai.” Yet Dr. Latham finds no
Australian dialects resemble those of the Asiatic Isles. Mr. Norris
first detected similarity of the grammar between the Australian and
the South Dravidian languages of India, spoken before the Aryan
migration to the Ganges. Mr. J. R. Logan, of Singapore, thinks the
Australian the most ancient of the Indo-Australian tongues. He
says they are “a remnant of the Proto-Scythic era of the harmonic
development, and between Chinese and American.” He regards them, with
the other kindred dialects of South-Eastern Asia, as in existence
“before the expansion of the numerals one, two, and three into
higher binary and ternary terms.” According to him, “the pronominal
roots are compounded with definitives, singular and plural, with the
numeral two to form duals, with masculine and feminine definitives in
the third person, and in all the three persons with each other; thus
producing not only absolute and relative plurals of the first person,
but several other complex plurals.”

the Niger. Rask’s “Vejledning,” 8vo, Copenhagen, 1828. _See_ AQUAPIM.


ACHÆMENIAN PERSIAN.

The name of that form of the Old PERSIAN language which is used in
the inscriptions of the Achæmenian kings, or the line of native
monarchs which commenced with Cyrus the Great and terminated with
Darius Codomannus, the antagonist of Alexander. The language is
written in an arrow-headed or cuneiform character of a simple kind,
and is closely akin to the Zend, Pazend, and the modern Persian.
The best work on the language is that of Spiegel, “Altpersische
Keilinschriften.” G. R.

A language of the MALAYAN family, spoken in the kingdom of Ache or
Achin, the northernmost part of Sumatra. It is distinguished from all
other Malay languages by having the accent on the terminal instead
of the penultimate syllable, and by a good deal of monosyllables. It
is at present very little known, but its presumed affinity to the
monosyllabic languages of Asia renders its study highly interesting
for investigating the origin of the Malay race. P. J. V.


ACOMA.

A dialect of native AMERICAN, vernacular in New Mexico. It is one of
the dialects spoken by the Pueblo Indians on the R. Grande. It is
also called LAGUNA.

the country. Salt’s “Voyage,” Appdx. i., p. 6. C. T. B.


AGGLUTINATIVE.

A name applied to certain languages, when “two unaltered roots
combine to form words;” and words brought into mutual relation by
syntax undergo a change of form, accent, or meaning; the COPTIC, for
example, is considered as essentially agglutinative. The American
agglutinative languages are called polysynthetic or incorporating.
These languages have generally little or no literature.


AGOLELEGMÜT.

The ESKIMO of N. America and Behring’s Straits, especially the island
of Nunivok. The terminal “müt,” which is common from Behring’s
Straits to the parts about Mount St. Elias, is derived from the
Eskimo. See Chromtschenko’s “Reise-Journal,” 8vo, St. Petersburgh,
1824. R. G. L.


AHOM.

A nearly extinct language formerly spoken in Assam, a province of
British India; it is a dialect of SIAMESE, monosyllabic in form, and
appears to have been transported by emigration from the borders of
China.


AHT, THE.

American: dialect of Van Couver Island; spoken by all the W. coast
tribes, from S. of Quatseeno to Port San Juan on De Fucas Straits.

in “aht.” R. B.


AHTIAGO.

A dialect of MALAY, vernacular in Ceram, closely allied to TELUTI and
ALFUROS.

⁂ The more correct form would be ATIAHU, the name of a village on
the S. coast, with a mixed population. The vocabulary quoted by Mr.
Wallace does not constitute a distinct dialect. P. J. V.


AIAWONG.

A dialect of native AUSTRALIAN, belonging to the W. coast.


AIMARA.

A dialect of the Indians of S. America, largely augmented by Spanish.
The natives were subject to the Incas of Peru, at the conquest, and
now inhabit the high ground near Lake Titicaca or Chucuito. They are
closely allied to the Quichua or native Peruvians. _See_ AYMARA.


AIMAUK.

A dialect of MOGHOL, spoken by the Tshehar-Aimauk, N. W. Afghanistan,
in the neighbourhood of Herat.

in the Hervey group, S. Pacific. Example, “mau-tangata” = “men.” W. G.


AKA (1).

A dialect spoken by a hill-tribe to the N. of Assam. It is almost
identical with ABOR. See Brown’s Table: “Transactions of the Asiatic
Society of Bengal,” 1837.


AKA (2).

African: sometimes used for the YORUBA, of which it is a sub-dialect.


AKABI, _see_ UKUAFI.


AKKADIAN.

A name sometimes given to the language used on the earliest
Babylonian bricks, especially those found at Mugheir (Ur), Warka
(Erech), Senkareh, Niffer, and other very ancient Mesopotamian
cities. The general character of the language is TURANIAN; but its
vocabulary connects it with the dialects of Southern Arabia and
Abyssinia, more especially with the Mahra, Galla, and Wolaitsa. The
writing is a rude and very complicated cuneiform. It is supposed that
the language was spoken in Babylonia from a very early age (B.C.
2500?) to the date of the Assyrian conquest, about B.C. 1300. By that
time it had become the language of an extensive literature, and as
such, continued to be studied by the more learned Assyrians down to
the close of the Empire, B.C. 624. The later Assyrian tablets are
to a great extent translations from it. See Rawlinson’s “Ancient
Monarchies,” vol. i., pp. 61-69, 2nd ed. G. R.


AKKIM.

African: a sub-dialect of FANTI.


AKO.

An African dialect, somewhat allied to AFUDU.


AKRA.

African. Language of the Gold-coast, for the parts about Cape Castle.
_See_ AQUAPIM.


AKRIPON.

African: a sub-dialect of FANTI.

A dialect of LESGIAN, spoken in Daghestan (the ancient Albania), a
district situated between the Caspian and the Black Sea.


AKWAMBU, _see_ AQUAPIM.


ALABAMA.

AMERICAN. Derived from “Alibamon,” the original occupants of the
modern State so called.


ALANI.

A people originally settled in Eastern Europe and Western Asia, very
powerful from about A.D. 75 to A.D. 461. They are now generally
considered to have been of the FINNISH stock, akin to the Ostiaks,
Samoeids, and other races of Northern Asia. G. R.


ALARODII, _see_ URARDA.


ALATYAN.

A name used by Prof. Steinthal for the URAL-ALTAIC or TURANIAN
languages.


ALBANIAN.

The vernacular tongue of modern Albania, a maritime province of
European Turkey, which answers to the ancient Epirus; the inhabitants
are a mixed race, including Arnauts, who are probably descended from
the ancient Illyrians, Greeks, and Turks. The ancient language,
called old ILLYRIAN, and closely allied to GREEK, has become mingled
with SLAVONIC, written in GREEK characters. The native name of the
Albanian dialect is SKIPETAR. Both terms mean “mountaineers.” The
modern language is sub-divided into the GHEGH and the TOSKI. See
Hahn: “Albanische Studien,” Jena, 1854.


ALEMANNIC _or_ ALLEMANIAN.

The oldest form of TEUTONIC or HIGH-GERMAN with which we are
acquainted; it is the language attributed to the Suevi or Swabians,
who, emigrating to the S., formed with other tribes a great
confederation on the Rs. Maine, Rhine, and Danube.

⁂ See Bosworth’s “Dict. of the Anglo-Saxon Language,” ed. 1838, p.
120. W. W. S.


ALEUTIAN _or_ ALIOUT-LISEYEFF.

The dialect of the Aleutian or Fox Islands, in the N. Pacific,
between Asia and America. The inhabitants resemble the MOGHOLS
in physical peculiarities, but their language is allied to the

INTRODUCTION.


AMHARIC.

The Court tongue of Abyssinia for many centuries. Amhara proper is
that district lying between the Dender and Tacazze branches of the
Nile. It closely resembles the ETHIOPIC, with alphabets that are
nearly identical. The root word is probably identical with “Ham” or
“Chem,” the poetical name for Egypt in the Psalms of David.

⁂ A SEMITIC dialect sprung from the ancient ETHIOPIC, which has
gradually become the dominant language of Abyssinia. Its vocabulary
and grammar still closely resemble the Ethiopic, but it has adopted a
barbarous pronunciation, and the gutturals, which form so important
a part of the Semitic alphabet, are no longer pronounced. The best
memoir upon it is that by Gesenius in the Encyclopædia of Ersch and
Grüber, under the heading “Amharische Sprache.” Other Abyssinian
dialects are the ADARI, the AFAR, the SOMAULI, the SAHO, the
languages of Tigré, Danakil, Adaiel, and of Harar. R. P. S.

Persians, and “Amyrgians” (Ἀμύργιοι) by the Greeks. They seem to have
inhabited the high plateau between the Thian-Chan and the Hindu-Kush
ranges. Most probably they were TURANIANS. G. R.


ANADEER _or_ ANADYR.

The upper and central parts of the R. Anadyr, on the north-eastern
extremity of Asia, are occupied by the Tshuktshi, an Asiatic tribe.
On the lower Anadyr, however, there is an Eskimo settlement. _See_
NAMOLLO. R. G. L.


ANAMITE _or_ ANNAMITE.

A name sometimes given to that dialect of the oldest ENGLISH which
was spoken in the north and east of England. It has been sub-divided

ANGLO-SAXON.

A compound language formed by the union of several tribes of Teutonic
origin, who conquered and settled in Britain, about A.D. 449, thence
called England. The language is of cognate origin with the ALEMANNIC
and GOTHIC; but with accretions from the SCANDINAVIAN and LOW-DUTCH.

⁂ What is called ANGLO-SAXON is really the oldest form of ENGLISH.
The Anglo-Saxon of the first period extends from A.D. 450 to A.D.
1100; that of the later period from A.D. 1100 to about A.D. 1250;
after which date we arrive at early Middle English. The specimens
of the literature are too numerous to require mention. See the
dictionaries by Lye and Manning, Bosworth, Grein, Ettmüller, and the

ARABIC.

One of the three main branches of the SEMITIC family, spoken in the
peninsula of Arabia. Unknown till the century before Mahomet, it
suddenly then reached its highest perfection in the poems of the
Moallakât. It is the richest, the most flexible, and most exact
of all the Semitic tongues, and its grammar the most subtle and
perfect, probably, of all known languages. The dialect of the tribe
of Koreisch, adopted by Mahomet in the Koran, has been, since the
seventh century, the classical language of large parts of Asia and
Africa, and has greatly influenced the Turkish, Maltese, Persian,
Hindi, and other tongues, owing to the wide range of Arabian
conquest. Classical Arabic must be distinguished from Arabic as
actually spoken. The “vulgar” Arabic makes scarcely any distinction
of vowel-sounds, has a grammar simple to rudeness, and is destitute
of the richness and versatility of the tongue as employed by its most
famous scholars. R. P. S.


ARAGO.

A dialect of PAPUAN, vernacular in New Guinea.


ARAIACU.

who places it in his CREN or GUERENO class. R. G. L.


ARAKANESE _or_ ARRACANESE.

A monosyllabic tongue closely allied to the BURMESE, otherwise called
the RECCAN or RUKHENG. The district in which it is spoken forms a
narrow strip of sea-coast, about 500 miles long, extending from
Cape Negrais in the S. towards Chittagong in the N., along the E.
peninsula of S. Asia.


ARAMAIC.

Generic name of the languages spoken in the region extending from the
Taurus and Lebanon to the R. Tigris. It is one of the main branches
of the SEMITIC stem, and is itself divided into two dialects, EAST
ARAMAIC, or CHALDEAN, and WEST ARAMAIC, or Syriac. The former became
the medium of Jewish thought, and is the language of the Targums
and the Talmud, and also of the Samaritan Pentateuch. The latter is
Christian. A sub-dialect spoken by the heathen is called SABAEAN, or
NABATHEAN. The oldest remains of the Aramaic are found in the name
given by Laban to the Hill of Witness between him and Jacob. R. P. S.

The Aramaic alphabet was identical with, or derived from, the
PHŒNICIAN.

ARCHAIC GREEK.

A name for the original CADMEAN alphabet of ancient Greece, it
consisted of seventeen letters only, and was derived from the
PHŒNICIAN.


ARDA.

Spoken, according to Alcedo, on the Upper Napo, on the boundaries of
New Grenada, Brazil, and Ecuador. A “Doctrina Christiana,” Madrid,
1658, and a “Paternoster” are the only recorded specimens of the
ARDA. No philologist seems to have examined them. The fragmentary
languages with which they are the most likely to have been allied are
the ANDOA, the SHIMIGAES, and the ZAPARA. “Ludwig,” p. 12. R. G. L.

original, attributed to Miesrob, A.D. 406.

⁂ The language is essentially an ARYAN dialect, akin to ACHÆMENIAN
PERSIAN and ZEND, but still distinct from either: into which have
been absorbed a large number of TURANIAN roots. G. R.


ARMENIC.

A branch of the great Indo-European family of speech not yet clearly

dialect of Samoa and Sandwich groups. First reduced by missionaries
from Hawaii, 1858; now occupied by Samoan Christian teachers. W. G.


ARROW-HEAD.

A term employed to designate writing of a particular kind. The
ancient inhabitants of Babylonia, Assyria, Armenia, Persia, and
other adjacent regions used characters of which the ultimate element
was the wedge: ► The resemblance of this form to the metallic point
with which arrows were anciently tipped caused our early Oriental
travellers to call all characters thus composed “arrow-headed.”
Recently, the term “cuneiform,” adopted from the French, has
displaced “arrow-headed,” which is now seldom used. It is important
to remember that the two terms, whichever of them we employ, in no
case properly designate a language, or an alphabet, but simply a
manner of forming the conventional signs of speech. There are at
least five quite distinct “arrow-headed” alphabets; and in one case
the same cuneiform alphabet is used to give written expression to two
quite different languages. G. R.


ARYAN.

A name for the INDO-EUROPEAN family of languages, derived from
Ariana, a province of the ancient Persian empire. The word is widely
diffused throughout Eastern Asia: _ex. gr._, the small river Arius,
now Heri-Rúd, on which stands the city of Herat; also the river Arus,
or Araxes, near Mt. Ararat, in Armenia; Iran, Irac, or Iron. The term
“Aryan,” in Sanskrit, implies “noble,” but the root is very widely
diffused in an agricultural sense; as in the Greek ἀρόω; Latin, “aro”
“to plough;” English, “arable.”

The Aryan family of languages is divided into the following
branches:—ARMENIC, CELTIC or KELTIC, HELLENIC, ILLYRIC, INDIC,
IRANIC, ITALIC, TEUTONIC, and WENDIC (or SLAVONIC-LETTIC). Each of
these groups or branches will be treated under its proper stem, with
sub-branches. _See_ INTRODUCTION. ☞

ASSAMESE.

The modern language of Assam, an extensive province of British India
adjoining Bengal; it extends along the course of the R. Brahmapootra,
towards Thibet. The archaic dialect known as AHOM, being extinct,

unintelligible to the natives of Bengal. It is written in the Bengali
character. See Brown’s “Comparative Table of Dialects: Asiatic
Society of Bengal.”

ASSYRIAN.

The language of the ancient Assyrians, or people of Assyria, a
tract lying upon the R. Tigris, between the thirty-fourth and
thirty-seventh parallels. This language has become known to us
within the last twenty years, through inscriptions disinterred from
the buried cities of this region. The form of speech is found to be
SEMITIC, akin to Arabic, Syriac, Chaldee, Phœnician, and especially
to Hebrew. It is written, however, unlike most Semitic tongues, from
left to right. The characters are very numerous and complicated;
they are of the class called “cuneiform” or “arrow-headed,” being
formed out of combinations of wedges. The best account of the
Assyrian alphabet will be found in the “Expédition Scientifique
en Mésapotamie” of M. Oppert. The language must be studied in the
“Assyrian Dictionary” of Mr. Norris, and the “Elémens de la Grammaire
Assyrienne” of M. Oppert. G. R.

seems to predominate. This language ought not to be confounded
with the low-Malay spoken at Batavia by Europeans and natives in

introduction of foreign words and forms of speech. To these Europeans
the language which the natives use among themselves is quite
unintelligible. P. J. V.

(1) GERMAN: the typical language of modern HIGH-DUTCH, which is
naturally derived from the ancient ALEMANNIC, and allied to GOTHIC,
which, however, is classed as LOW-GERMAN. It is, in many dialects,
the vernacular speech of the Empire of Germany, Prussia, Austria,
Bavaria, &c. The form of its printed letters is of the class called
Gothic, and both closely resemble Old English black-letter, but the
use of Roman letter is gaining ground. Dictys. by Heyse, Hilpert,
Sanders, Flügel, Grimm, Lucas, &c., Grammars by Grimm, Kehrein, &c.

(2) OLD HIGH-GERMAN. See Massmann: “Gedrängtes althochdeutsches

(3) MIDDLE HIGH-GERMAN. See Benecke: “Wörterb.,” 4 vols., Leipsig,
1854-60; Ziemann, 1838. _See_ GERMANIC.

(4) NEW HIGH-GERMAN. _See_ LUTHERAN.

(5) Dialects. See Jülg’s “Vater,” pp. 84-93; Works by Hoefer,
Schmeller, Weinhold, &c.

(6) NIEDER PLATT-DEUTSCH, or LOW-GERMAN. _See_ DUTCH.


GERMANIC.

The main stem of TEUTONIC: divided into (1) HIGH-GERMAN, (2)
LOW-GERMAN.

Under (1) we class the sub-branches called OLD HIGH-GERMAN and
MIDDLE HIGH-GERMAN; from which again issue the modern dialects
of HIGH-GERMAN. Under (2) we class MŒSO-GOTHIC, ANGLO-SAXON, OLD
DUTCH, OLD FRISIAN, and OLD SAXON, from which again issue the modern
dialects of England, Friesland, N. Germany (PLATT-DEUTSCH), Holland,
and Flanders.

in spite of the geographical position, it is no mere dialect of the

An extinct idiom of Teutonic, classed as LOW-GERMAN. The Goths
formed that large body of people who, under the names of “ostro,”
_i.e._ Eastern, and “visi,” _i.e._ Western Goths, harassed the
latter centuries of imperial Rome. The most permanent record of
their tongue is found in the “Codex Argenteus,” or “Silver Book,” an
imperfect version of the four Gospels, now preserved at Upsala in
Sweden; it has frequently been printed, and represents the dialect
of the Mœso-Goths, who were settled in ancient Mœsia, S. of the
Danube, under the Emperor Valens. This version is attributed to
Bishop Ulphilas or Little Wolf, who translated the Scriptures into
Gothic, using an alphabet constructed by himself and adapted to
their phonesis, said to be derived from the Greek, A.D. 318-378.

HAYU, _see_ VAYU.


HEBRÆO-AFRICAN.

An epithet invented by Dr. J. Cowles Prichard, in imitation of
Indo-European, to include a group of African languages which have
definite relations to the HEBREW. These are especially the Abyssinian
languages, the GALLA, the COPTIC, and the LIBYAN. Within the limits
of an article we cannot state all the points of relationship, but
we may note the remarkable similarity of the first and second
pronouns, the mode of conjugating, the principal tense of the verb,
the facility of forming derivative verbs from a primary (but the
languages connected with Turkish have this), the inaptitude in
compounding words, even so far as not even to prefix prepositions to
verbs. The Abyssinian languages come nearest to Hebrew, and next the
Libyan. Tutscheh notes the singular approximation of the Galla to the
Arabic in the syntax used with the plural of nouns. The Coptic is of
all the most distant from Hebrew. F. W. N.


HEBREW.

SEMITIC: closely allied to ARAMAIC and PHŒNICIAN. It is an extinct
dialect spoken by the ancient Jews of Palestine, and preserved to us
in their sacred writings known as the Old Testament Scriptures. The
old Hebrew character, as found on coins, &c., has much resemblance
to Phœnician. The Biblical alphabet, called Square Hebrew, has been
traced by some to the captivity at Babylon, B.C. 603-536, but is
regarded by others as much more recent. The Rabbinic characters are
of a more cursive form, and the modern Jews of Germany and Poland
used running hands of somewhat differing forms. For LATER HEBREW,
_see_ TALMUDIC, and for MODERN HEBREW, _see_ JEWEY. Lexicons by

HIMYARITIC _or_ HIMJARITE.

Name for the characters used in some early inscriptions of S. Arabia
in a dialect allied to the MAHARI of Abyssinia. Mr. Palgrave,
“Central and E. Arabia,” vol ii., p. 240, states that the modern
Himyarites, who speak a dialect of modern Arabic, are called the
“reds”: “ahmar” in Arabic; but it seems more probable that they are
the Hi or Hy-Mahari: “Hy” being a tribal prefix in Africa as in
Ireland. Compare the Hi-breasail, the Hy-Many, or O’Kelly people; the
Hy-Fiachrach or O’Dowdy people. The use of the same prefix in Africa
is proved by the Ki-Suaheli, the Hi or Ki-Kamba, Ki-Sambala; cf. the
Heb. ‏ה‎; ‏ח‎; which gives the transition from “h” to “ch” or “k”;
thus also we may have Ki-Afer for the people of Africa, the original
Kaffirs: indeed we have the mature word in Ke-Kuafi, _see under_ U.
Hy-mahari would mean “the shore-people.” _See_ EKHKILI.


HINANTSHI _or_ HINA.

African: assigned by Barth to HAMARUA.


HINDI _or_ HINDUWI.

The vernacular language of native Hindoos; it is derived from
SANSKRIT, and closely adhered to by all the Brahmin castes. It
was probably the court tongue of Canaug or Kanoj, a chief city of
Hindostan when Alexander the Great crossed the Indus and defeated
Porus, B.C. 327. The language has many branches or sub-dialects, and
is written in the Devanagri, or sacred alphabet used in the Vedas;
also in Kyt’hí, a sort of running hand. Ballantyne: “Elements,”
London, 1869; “Chrestomathie,” Garcin de Tassy, Paris, 1849.


HINDOO.

Class name for the INDIAN branch of the ARYAN family of languages,
derived, according to some, from “Hapta Hendu,” “Seven Rivers,” old
name for the Punjaub.


HINDOSTANI _or_ URDU.

The vernacular tongue of the Indian Moslemim, or Mussulmen; first
originated by the Muhammadan invaders, _circa_ A.D. 1004. It is a
compound of ARABIC and PERSIAN with SANSKRIT, called URDU-ZABAN, or
“camp lingo,” and written in a cursive character, called Taghlik,
derived from Arabic; also in uncial letters formed from Sanskrit.
N.B.—Hindu-stan means the “land of the Hindoos.” Forbes: “Dicty. H.
and Eng.,” 1859; “Grammar,” 1849.

INDIANS.

N. AMERICAN: The Nova Scotia Indians have all decayed away. They were
a people who in their habits more especially used the sea-coast,
banks of lakes, rivers, &c.; the mountaineer is the country Indian,
solely engaged in hunting spoils for trade and subsistence. The E.
States have still a sprinkling of mongrel races, so intermixed as to
leave but a slight trace of the old N. American sons of the forest.
The Red Indian of Newfoundland was cannibal in his habits, and the
race is utterly extinct. I have not met, on the Labrador, any mixture
between the Esquimaux and the mountaineer and Mic-mac tribes, but
frequently children of English and Esquimaux. J. T.


INDIC.

A name for the HINDOO branch of the great ARYAN family of languages,
comprising SANSKRIT, PRAKRIT, PALI, MAHRATTA, HINDI, BENGALI, &c. The
country N. of the Indus was called Arya-âvarta, “abode of the Aryas.”

⁂ A S.W. branch of the great ARYAN family, who in pre-historic
times were settled to the N. and N.W. of Kâbul, became in the end
the Brahmanic Aryans of India, and the Zoroastrian Aryans of Iran
(Persia). There is no doubt that the Indian Aryans travelled mainly
to the S.W., crossing first, and settling in the Land of the Seven
Rivers—the Indus, Punjâb (or Five Rivers), and the Sarasvâti—and
that they proceeded thence gradually along the Jumna and Ganges,
till they reached the Bay of Bengal. Ultimately, under the name of
Hindûs (whence Hindûstan), they occupied all the district around and
in connection with this great river system, displacing and driving
to the south an earlier race, who still inhabit the S.E. and S. of
the Deccan (Dakshina, so called as on the right hand—dexter—of the
invading Hindû race), and who are allied to the Moghols of Central
Asia. The dialect of the earlier, as of the existing populations to
the S. and E., is of Turanian or Nishada origin. The principal Aryan
dialects at present are BENGALI, HINDI, and MAHRATTA, all of them
lineal descendants of the Devanagari or Sanskrit, which is no longer
a spoken language. HINDUSTANI, though mainly Aryan in its vocabulary,
and wholly so in its structure, is rather the language of general
communication than a distinct dialect. See “Comparative Grammar of
the Aryan Languages of India,” by Beames. W. S. W. V. _See_ DRAVIDIAN.


INDO-CHINESE.

A collective term for a class of languages embracing ANAMITE,

INSCRIPTIONS.

The most durable means of preserving individual records of written
speech. They are termed, variously, “incised,” “impressed,”
“lapidary,” “monumental,” “numismatic,” “painted.” The famous Rosetta
and Carpentras stones, and the decree of Canopus from Egypt, and
the Behistun rock inscriptions, are examples of bilingual records,
that serve, by means of comparison, to facilitate decipherment. The
Assyrian cuneiform writing and the Egyptian hieroglyphs have thus
been explained, and the Chinese have in use extensive libraries of
stone inscriptions at the present day. See Gesenius: “Scripturæ
Linguæque Phœniciæ Monumenta,” 2 vols., Leipsig, 1837.

the Onondagas, the Senecas, the formidable Mohawks, and others are,
probably, the most familiar representatives of the traditional Red
Indian, especially in his capacity of hero and warrior. R. G. L.

Tuscany, and now forms one of the most refined languages of modern
society, lending itself specially to the requirements of vocal
melody. See Manuzzi: “Vocab. della Crusca,” 4 vols., Florence, 1868.

symbol, has become letter A; “beth”—a house, has become B; “ghimel”—a
camel, has become G, or C, and so on. _See_ PHONOLOGY.

LIBYAN.

Languages often called by the vague term BERBER. These languages
must now be reckoned as at least five in number: the SHOWIAH, or
Algerine Berber; the SHILHA, or Morocco Berber; the TAMASHIGHT, or
Berber south of Mount Atlas. The last is the purest and most widely
extended. Besides these there are two others of very limited extent,
that of the town of Ghadames and that of the Benî Menasser. These
languages were formerly all one, as Augustine says: “In Africâ
barbaras gentes in unâ linguâ plurimas novimus.” Hanoteau has made
the very interesting remark that to translate from the Tamashight
into Arabic, and reciprocally, though the vocabulary is widely
different, is peculiarly easy, yet this proves common cultivation
rather than a common origin. In a preface to the 4th appendix to
Barth’s fifth volume of “Travels in Africa,” a summary is given by
Professor F. W. Newman of the grammatical relations of the three
chief languages to one another, but it was written without the
advantage of Hanoteau’s Tamashight Grammar. We can now judge pretty
accurately how they are all related to Hebrew. F. W. N. _See_

bilingual, Phœnician, and Lybian. H. C.

by Kessler, London, 1870; Grammar by Van der Tuuk.

(2) BATAVIAN or LOW-MALAY. See “Handleiding,” by Homan and Van der
Tuuk. Zalt-Bommel, 1868.

⁂ Low-Malay is merely corrupt Malay, as introduced by Europeans.
The best vocabulary is by Badings, Dutch-Malay and Malay-Dutch,
Schoonhoven, 1872. Batavian-Malay is a dialect of SUNDANESE, with an
admixture of BALINESE and other foreign words. P. J. V.

(3) Dialects are known as AMBOYNESE MALAY, MENANG KABAW, or SUMATRAN
MALAY, ACHINESE and other Polynesian forms.

⁂ All languages spoken in the Indian or Malay Archipelago [except
those of the Galela group], and not directly Papuan, are called
“Malay languages,” and considered to belong to the one great Malayan
family.

More particularly Malay is the language of a nation spread over
a great part of Sumatra, the Malay Peninsula, Singapore, and the
archipelago of Rhio-Lingga, and which has founded many colonies
on the coasts of Borneo and the eastern islands of the Indian
Archipelago. Besides the common or so-called cosmopolitan Malay, it
is spoken in a peculiar dialect, called the Menangkabau Malay, in the
interior of Sumatra.

Malay in a very corrupt form, disfigured by ignorance of the
character of the language, and the arbitrary intermixture of foreign
words, has become the ordinary means of intercourse between Europeans
and the natives of the Indian Archipelago. This is called Low-Malay,
and differs in almost every locality.

Malay is written with the Arabic character. Through the contact with
Europeans the use of the Roman alphabet is gaining ground.

The affinities of Achinese are still very obscure, and we have
no vocabulary of the native language except that in Marsden’s
miscellaneous works; therefore Mr. Crawfurd errs when he calls
Achinese (p. lix.) “a cultivated and written language,” for the
literary language of the Achinese is genuine Malay. P. J. V.

S. peninsula, viz., in the capital of Celebes and its environs; in
Tallo, Gowa, Saurabone, Takalar, Turuteya, Bouthain, and part of
Bulecomba. It is nearly allied to BUGIS, which is spoken in Maros,
Pangkajene, Segéri, Tanette, Barru, the Aja Tapparang, the remaining
part of Bulecomba, Boui, Soppeng, Waju, and Luwu.

⁂ The grammatical structure and syntax are alike in Bugis and
Mangkasar, though the difference of words is considerable, and the
alphabet is the same in the main, with slight modifications, but not
sufficient to justify the assertion of Mr. Wallace (“Malay. Archip.,”
vol. ii., p. 472) that Bugis is written in a native character
distinct from that of Macassar. There still exist some ancient MSS.,
written in an older alphabet, now quite obsolete. See “Makassaarche

MASORETIC.

HEBREW: “Masora,” _i.e._ “traditional”; applied to the received

introduced to supply the want of vowels.


MASSACHUSETT.

American: extinct dialect of ALGONKIN. Vocaby.: “Amer. Ethnol.,” vol.
ii., p. 110.

⁂ The name carries with it its own geographical position. The town
of Boston, U.S., now stands on the land of the Massachusett Indians.
I find that NATIK or NADICK is rather a synonym for MASSACHUSETTS
than the name of a separate form of speech, whether language or
dialect; on the coast, the name changed, and the language also, which
is NARRAGANSET. The two forms are closely allied, but MASSACHUSETTS
means the parts about Boston, NARRAGANSET the language of Connecticut
and Rhode Island. The greatest work in any American language is,
undoubtedly, the translation of the Bible by Eliot; but no one knows
whether the language is to be called NATICK or MASSACHUSETT. Eliot
also wrote a Grammar, dated A.D. 1666; the author merely calls it
INDIAN; reprinted at Boston in 1832. R. G. L.


MASSARATTY.

MAYA or MAYAN.

AMERICAN: Class name for many languages of Central America,
especially those of Yucatan and Guatemala. In the former it rules
exclusively; in the latter it is a closely allied form of speech.
The POCONCHI (with the exception of certain rude dialects belonging
to the same class) is the representative language. The KACHIQUEL is
a third language of equal importance. In Vera Cruz, for the parts
about Tampico, an allied language, the HUASTECA, separated from its
congeners, is (or was) the original vernacular. Grammatical sketches,
“artes,” as they are called by early missionaries are as early and
fully as numerous for the Maya languages and dialects as for any in
America, dating from the seventeenth century. A short but valuable
work by Squier is the chief authority for them. “States of Central
America,” by T. G. Squier, N. York, 1858; “Etudes,” by Brassier
De Bourbourg, Paris, 1869-70; “Silabario,” by Ruz, Merida, 1845;

MECKLENBURG.

Teutonic: sub-dialect of LOW-GERMAN. Grammar by Ritter, Rostock, 1832.


MECKLEY, _see_ MOITAY.


MEDIAN.

Properly the language of the ancient Medes, a people of the high
country between Mesopotamia and the Persian desert, only known
through names and a few words, which show it to have been ARYAN, and
closely allied to ancient PERSIAN. The term “Median” was at one time
applied to the language of the third column of Achæmenian cuneiform
inscriptions, but it is now admitted that this was a misnomer. On the
real Median language, see Rawlinson: “Ancient Monarchies,” Media,
vol. iii., pp. 137-156. G. R.


MEDO-PERSIAN.

Class name for the branch of ARYAN speech, with slight differences,
common to the ancient Medes and Persians. G. R.


MEDO-SCYTHIAN.

Dr. Hincks’ name for the language of Scythic tribes dwelling in
Media and Persia, known to us by a peculiar form of inscriptions in
cuneiform.

⁂ The best account of the language, which is decidedly TURANIAN, will
be found in Norris’s “Scythic Inscriptions of Behistun,” “Jnl. of R.
As. Soc.,” vol. xv. G. R.

consisting of the Loyalty group, Bank’s Santa Cruz, the Solomon
Archipelago extending W. by N., to include New Guinea.


MELLELE.

Class of GIPSEY.


MELON.

African: allied to NHOTEN and NHALEMOE. H. C.


MEMPHITIC.

Egyptian: an extinct dialect of COPTIC; it was spoken over the
district about Memphis, and represented the language of middle rather
than upper or lower Egypt. R. G. L.


MENADO _or_ MENADU.

A large class of dialects spoken in Celebes or Macassar, classed as
ALFURU, and somewhat allied to BUGIS. (Wallace.) _See_ MINAHASSA.


MENAK.

Javanese: in the SUNDANESE dialect “Ménak” means “a noble, one of
high birth;” hence high-Sundanese is called BASA-MENAK. P. J. V.


MENANGKABAW.

MALAYAN: dialect of the Dutch residency in the highlands of Padang,
Sumatra, which was anciently an independent monarchy called MENANG
KABAW. It differs considerably from ordinary Malay. Vocabulary, &c.,
edited by Pynappel (Dialogues: Menangkabaw and Malay). P. J. V.


MENASSER (BENI).

Language of the BENI MENASSER, a branch of the BERBER. See LIBYAN.
Baron de Slane first published the pronouns of this language, which
differ so much from the other Libyan languages that it must be
unintelligible to those who know only the others; yet it is small
and unimportant. H. Duveyrier (1857) places the tribes near to the
Hhallûla Lake, and says that they have adopted Arab manners, an
Arabic name, and an immensity of the Arabic language. He gives an
extremely limited vocabulary. He thinks that it and the dialect
called that of the Benî Mezâb, is a branch of the ZENATIA dialect,
and is connected with that spoken in the oasis of Touât. But the last
is supposed to be TAMASHIGHT. F. W. N.

Cordier, Bar-le-Duc, 1843.


MEWARA.

Same as RHATORE, sub-dialect of BOWRI.


MEXICAN.

It is of some importance to remember that MEXICAN is not a
philological but a geographical term, and that the indigenous name
of the occupants of the parts about the present city of Mexico was
Nahuatl, akin to whom were the Tlaskala. The Asteks were conquerors
and intruders—the Chetimacha probably the same. This is important
when we remember that the three names, Nahuatl, Huasteca, and
Tlaskala are to be found in three different districts far away
from Mexico. At present MEXICAN and ASTEK are nearly synonymous;
just like Quichua and Peruvian. See “Dialogues,” by Arenas, Paris,
1862; Glossary by Biondelli, Milan, 1869; “Cuadro Descriptivo,”
by Pimentel, 1862-5. For Picture Character, see Humboldt’s “Atlas

_i.e._, Aborigines. Vocaby. by Edkins, Foochow.


MIC-MAC.

American: FRENCH name for the native Indians of Nova Scotia, &c.

⁂ (1) As a special name it means the ALGONKIN of New Brunswick, Nova
Scotia, Cape Breton, and Prince Edward’s Island. The still more
special name for the present dialect is MIRAMICHI.

(2) As a class name it may conveniently be made to include (i.) on
the North the Skoffi and Sheshatapoosh of Labrador; (ii.) the MIC-MAC
proper of the South; (iii.) the New England forms of speech, as the
ABENAKI, PENOBSCOT, and ETCHEMIN, whence we derived the present
name for the State of Mayne. It corresponds thus with the ACADIAN
and GASPESIAN of the French, including the French denominations
Souriquois, Montagnard, and others. Grammar by Maillard, New York,
1864. R. G. L.

Sub-dialect of DYAK in Borneo.

MINCOPIE.

Dialect of the Andaman Islands.

⁂ In the Great Andaman island of the Indian Seas at least two
distinct languages are known, viz., that of Colebrooke’s Vocabulary,
and that of Tickell’s. These people are Negritos of small stature and

MINETARI.

American: dialect of SIOUX, N. division, called “Grosventre,” _i.e._

⁂ Dr. Latham objects to the word “Alasar.” According to that great
authority it is a misnomer, arising from some confusion between the
words “Ahnenin” and “Atsina.” The former are classed by Gallatin as
ARRAPAHOES. See “Amer. Ethnol.,” vol. ii., where the same vocabulary
is printed as ATSINA. We have no original authority for the word
“Alasar,” but it appears in Jülg’s “Vater,” p. 253. See Trübner’s

The proper spelling of words. In the present work all various

found in trans-literating proper names from foreign languages;
modes of spelling fluctuate rapidly, becoming in general a mere

long-established usage in such words as Mongol and Tartar; but an
attempt has been made to give the most recent forms in addition.

⁂ Much has been written of this language on the strength of its real
or supposed monosyllabic structure—indeed, it has been compared
with the CHINESE. It is, however, truly American, differing, so
far as it indeed does differ from the others, in the fact of its
agglutination being either less, or less represented in the grammars
and vocabularies. See Grammar by Piccolomini, Rome, 1841. R. G. L.

properly to parchments which, after having been written on, have
been prepared for a fresh writing by an erasure of the original one.
In the middle ages, when parchment came to be scarce and dear, many
valuable MSS. were thus used, and a second worthless writing placed
over one infinitely more precious. In some cases the original MS. has
been recovered by careful examination, _e. g._, the text of Cicero’s
treatise, “De Republica.” G. R.

An aboriginal tribe of Greece. Herodotus states that their speech was

PERSIC.

Under this term are comprehended all the various forms of the Persian
language, with the exception of the dialect now spoken. The Persic is
known to us in three stages:—

(1) The language of the Achæmenian dynasty, recovered from the
cuneiform inscriptions of Cyrus, Darius, Xerxes, and other kings. See
Spiegel: “Die Altpersischen Keilinschriften,” Leipzig, 1862.

(2) The PEHLEVI or HUZVARESCH, the language of the Sassanian period
(A.D. 226-650). IRANIC, with considerable SEMITIC infusion; known
from coins, inscriptions, and literary productions.

(3) PARSI or PAZEND; the language as it reappears subsequently to the
Arab conquest; purified to a great extent of the Semitic ingredients,
and once more thoroughly IRANIC. Known from translations of the
Avesta, &c.

The PERSIC, in its earliest form, is closely allied to OLD BACTRIAN
or ZEND. Latterly it branched out into several dialects, as the DERI,
the HEREVI, the PARSI, or PAZEND, the SEGZI or dialect of Seistan,
the SOGDI of Sogdiana or Bokharia, and the ZAVULI of Zabulistan. G.

This is a geographical rather than a philological term. The Peruvian
area, nearly coinciding with the present republic of Peru, reaches
along the coast from the north of Quito, on the boundaries of the
Ecuador and New Grenada, to Chili, _i.e._ from the Equator to 24°
S.L. Its most eastern extension is in Tucuman; its general run,
however, is from north to south. The two (allied) languages which
most especially belong to it are the QUICHUA and AYMARA. Notices
of ruder tribes within the same area we have many, but with few
and exceptional vocabularies. JURACARES, MAYORUNA, and CALCHAQUI,

with ARABIC, yet retains its own forms of grammar. The Arabic article
“El” (or the letter L initial) is often imported with an Arabic
noun, as with us in the words “Alcoran,” “Alcohol”; and feminine
nouns take T at each end: as “Tamdint,” from Arabic Medina(t), city.
The language is spoken chiefly in the highlands of Mount Atlas,
towards Algiers, especially in the province of Constantine. There is
little doubt that it represents to us the ancient Numidian, and one
branch of the Gætulian. Brosselard’s Dictionary, “Français-Berbère,”
whatever its value to a traveller, disappoints a philologer; for
by far the greater part of it is Arabic in disguise. Hanoteau’s
“Grammaire Kabyle,” gives a large mass of pure words: he has selected
the Zouave dialect by preference. It is rougher than that of Bougie,
into which Sadi Hamet translated the book of Genesis and the four
Gospels for the Bible Society. F. W. N. _See_ LIBYAN.

the PALMYRENE, and the modern ARABIC. The view of the inscriptions
taken by the Rev. C. Forster (“Voice of Israel,” London, 1860) is not
generally endorsed by Semitic scholars, who assign the inscriptions
to a time a little earlier and a little later than our era. See Beer:

SUNDANESE.

The language of the western part of Java, separated from the genuine
Javanese districts by the rivers Chi Losari in the north and Chi
Tandooï in the south. The influence of the Hindoo colonists on this
part of Java has been very limited: hence both the people and their
language are less civilised than those of middle Java. The language,
though equally belonging to the MALAYAN family, differs considerably
from the Javanese, and seems to be more nearly akin to the BATTA
and MALAY of Sumatra. There is some difference between the high and
low language as in Javanese—the former being called BASA-MENAK, the
latter BASA-KURING. The number, however, of distinct Menak words
is not considerable, and most of them are derived from JAVANESE.
The Sundanese was, till recently, seldom written. The natives,
for writing it, make use either of the Arabic or of the Javanese
alphabet, the latter with some slight modifications. P. J. V. _See_

TAMAZIGHT, TAMASHIGHT, TAMACHEK’.

The language of the Tawâriq (Fr. Touâreg), as the Arabs name the
people who dwell over an immense space of Africa, south of the Atlas.
(_See_ LIBYAN for the class.) Dr. Richardson calls the language
TOUARGHEE; Duveyrier calls it TARGISCH. It is remarkably free from
Arabic importations, and has an alphabet of its own, highly peculiar,
called the Tefínagh; only consonants are written, so that the writing
is a shorthand, difficult to read; the more so, because the laws of
grammar help little to the vowels. Hanoteau defines the language as
“limited to the West by a curve line drawn from Waregla (Wergela)
through the oasis of Touât towards Timbuctoo; to the South by the
Niger and the kingdoms of Bornou and Haussa; to the East by Fezzan
and the country of the Tibboos; to the North by Tripoli, Tunis, and
Algiers.” This vast extent, as well as its purity, makes it the chief
of the LIBYAN languages. Its consonant sounds are fewer than those
of the Zouave, which has borrowed from Arabic. In the fifth volume
of Barth’s African Travels are words and sentences of considerable
extent in Tamashight; but the publication of Hanoteau’s ample Grammar
somewhat lessens their importance. F. W. N.

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope

free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg™
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg™ name associated with the work. You can easily

phrase “Project Gutenberg” is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and

derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase “Project

  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg™
  works.

• You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™'s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without
widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
